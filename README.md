# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone

Disclaimer: The project is for pedagogical purposes to apply the skills learned in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course.

Business task:
The purpose of this case study is to provide Bellabeat stakeholders insights into user preferences for industry-wide smart devices, to then use those insights to inform their marketing analytics team how best to proceed in the marketing of the Bellabeat Time product. The findings of this study are as follows:
•	  Users prefer the Apple Watch over the FitBit, based on their trend towards generalized use.
•	  Apple Watch uses accounted for 77% of activity in the data, and that activity was fairly equal between categories.
•	  FitBit users tended to use their device for fitness purposes, with the females aged 30 and under being a key demographic.
•	  Female users perform more steps by average than males users across both devices. Suggesting a tendency towards fitness.
•	  There is strong evidence to suggest marketing the Bellabeat Time as a general use smart device would cater to the widest demographic.
•	  However, if the fitness market is the goal, tailor your marketing strategy to female users 30 and under.
